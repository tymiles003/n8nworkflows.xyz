# Receive updates when an event occurs in Taiga

### 1. Workflow Overview

This workflow is designed to receive real-time updates when specific events occur in a Taiga project management environment. Its primary use case is to automate actions or notifications based on project changes tracked in Taiga. The workflow consists of a single logical block:

- **1.1 Taiga Event Reception:** This block sets up a webhook trigger that listens for events from a specified Taiga project and initiates the workflow when an event occurs.

### 2. Block-by-Block Analysis

#### 1.1 Taiga Event Reception

- **Overview:**  
  This block waits for and captures events emitted by a particular Taiga project. When an event related to the project is triggered, the workflow receives the data payload and activates subsequent processing steps (not included in this workflow).

- **Nodes Involved:**  
  - Taiga Trigger

- **Node Details:**  

  **Taiga Trigger**  
  - *Type and Technical Role:*  
    Taiga Trigger node listens for webhook calls from Taiga, allowing the workflow to start automatically upon project events.  
  - *Configuration Choices:*  
    - Configured with a specific Taiga project ID (`385605`), so it only listens to events from this project.  
    - Uses the Taiga Cloud API credentials named `taiga` for authentication.  
    - The webhook ID is predefined to receive incoming HTTP requests securely.  
  - *Key Expressions or Variables:*  
    - Project ID is statically set; no dynamic expressions used.  
  - *Input and Output Connections:*  
    - No input nodes, as this is a trigger node.  
    - No output nodes connected within this workflow (likely meant for expansion or integration).  
  - *Version-Specific Requirements:*  
    - Uses typeVersion 1 of the Taiga Trigger node; ensure n8n supports this version.  
  - *Edge Cases or Potential Failures:*  
    - Authentication failure if the Taiga API credentials are invalid or expired.  
    - Network issues causing webhook delivery failures.  
    - If the project ID is incorrect or the user lacks access, no events will be received.  
    - Event payload format changes could affect downstream processing if added later.  
  - *Sub-workflow Reference:*  
    - None in this workflow.

### 3. Summary Table

| Node Name     | Node Type           | Functional Role      | Input Node(s) | Output Node(s) | Sticky Note |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| Taiga Trigger | Taiga Trigger       | Event Listener for Taiga project updates | None          | None           |             |

### 4. Reproducing the Workflow from Scratch

1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a new node and select the **Taiga Trigger** node type.
3. Configure the **Taiga Trigger** node as follows:
   - Set the **Project ID** to `385605` to monitor events from this specific Taiga project.
   - Assign Taiga API credentials by selecting or creating the credential named `taiga`. This credential must include valid authentication details for the Taiga Cloud API.
4. Verify the webhook URL generated by the Taiga Trigger node. This URL needs to be registered with Taiga to allow event notifications.
5. Save the workflow.
6. (Optional) Activate the workflow to listen for live events.
7. Since there are no output nodes or further processing, this basic setup will receive event data from Taiga when the configured project triggers an event.

| Taiga Trigger node requires proper Taiga API credentials with sufficient permissions.         | https://docs.taiga.io/api.html                                |
| To receive events, the webhook URL generated by the Taiga Trigger node must be registered in Taiga under project webhooks. | Taiga project settings → Webhooks                             |
| Workflow is currently minimal and serves as a starting point for integrating Taiga events.    | Consider extending workflow with nodes to process event data |
